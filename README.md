# Fourier series drawing

This project draws an arbitrary curve using the discrete Fourier series to visualise it as a series of epicycles (rotating circles), functionally a sum of vectors.

## Usage

Go to the website at: [https://layanjethwa.github.io/Fourier-drawing/](https://layanjethwa.github.io/Fourier-drawing/)

Click in the left side of the screen to begin the drawing, and click again to finish drawing. As the Fourier series is periodic, a closed loop will work best.

The slower you draw, the more vectors it will have to compute, so don't draw for too long otherwise it will run quite slowly.

The left slider changes the frame rate, which changes the speed of the animation and the sampling rate. The right slider changes the resolution, by reducing or increasing the number of vectors modelled.
